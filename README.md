# What to Contribute

## Contribution Types
NIST is accepting the following contributions.

**Open Source Tools:** Tools can be solutions or processes, ranging from software to frameworks.

**Use Cases:** A use case is an example of an organization processing data about individuals for some explicit purpose(s) (e.g., where a goal is to prevent re-identification of the data during its processing, improve privacy risk management practices). 

**Feedback:** Help the community. Provide feedback on tools and use cases.

## Contribution Focus Areas
Please limit your contributions to the topics of de-identification or privacy risk management. But, we welcome [feedback](mailto:collabspace@nist.gov) on future topics of interest.

**De-identification:** a process that is applied to a dataset with the goal of preventing or limiting certain types of privacy risks to individuals, protected groups, and establishments, while still allowing for the production of aggregate statistics. We are accepting tools and use cases within a broad scope of de-identification to allow for noise-introducing techniques such as differential privacy, data masking, and the creation of synthetic datasets that are based on privacy-preserving models.

**Privacy Risk Management:** a process that enables organizations to achieve mission or business objectives while minimizing adverse outcomes for individuals arising from the processing of their data. This includes but is not limited to risk models, risk assessment methodologies, and approaches to determining privacy risk factors.

# How to Contribute

Tools and use cases are contributed via pull requests, while feedback is contributed via issues. Contributed tools and use cases can be hosted directly in this repository, or you can host them elsewhere online and link to them from this repository.

## How to Contribute Tools and Use Cases

1. Fork a copy of USNISTGOV/PrivacyEngCollabSpace to your own organizational or personal space. 

2. Create a branch in your fork, named specifically for your contribution. 

3. In your branch: 

	A. Create a new directory within the relevant tool or use case directory: tools/de-identification, tools/risk-management, use-cases/de-identification, or use-cases/risk-management. Example: *tools/de-identification/[your-contribution-name]*

	B. Name the directory to describe your contribution. 

	C. Include in the directory a README.md file that follows the relevant [template](https://github.com/usnistgov/PrivacyEngCollabSpace/tree/master/templates). There is a template for a [tool](https://github.com/usnistgov/PrivacyEngCollabSpace/tree/master/templates/tool-template) and for a [use case](https://github.com/usnistgov/PrivacyEngCollabSpace/tree/master/templates/use-case-template) contribution.

	D. If hosting a tool in this repository, also include in the directory any pertinent source code files or documentation. 

	E. Update the README.md file of the main directory to which youâ€™re contributing. This README provides an index of that directory's contents. It should include an entry reflecting your contribution. 

5. Create a [pull request](https://github.com/usnistgov/PrivacyEngCollabSpace/pull/new/master) (PR) from your branch to the master branch in USNISTGOV/PrivacyEngCollabSpace. 

6. Moderators will then review the PR and may provide comments and suggestions to the contributor. 

## How to Contribute Feedback 

Submit an [issue](https://github.com/usnistgov/PrivacyEngCollabSpace/issues/new) to provide feedback on tools or use cases in the space. Please select appropriate tags related to the feedback.
